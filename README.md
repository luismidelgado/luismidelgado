I strongly believe in pursuing business ideas during some of my free time. Here are some of mine.
     
I work on my own projects and I am always open to work on a project for others.

Some of them are small, some are large.
Some of them are just experiments, others make money.
Some of them suck, some of them suck just a little bit less.
Most of them got something that scared me a little at the time, after I finished it, not so much.

But they all taught me something.
     
I studied Telecommunications Technical Engineering as if that has served me in a world of changing challenges. It only gave me enough knowledge to realize how ignorant I was. The more I learn the more I discover how little I know.

My interests include a wide diversity of subjects, and among all of them is computing and experimenting with life.

I am an advocate for open science, open access, and open source.
