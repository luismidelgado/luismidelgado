     I work as a research assistant at the [Chair of the History of Technology at ETH Zurich](https://www.tg.ethz.ch/en/people/details/moritz-maehr/). I studied history and philosophy of knowledge, computer science and banking & finance in Zurich and Berlin. I am currently working on a dissertation on the history of information privacy and on the digitisation of the migration authorities in Switzerland. The study is part of the SNF-funded project [Trading Zones](http://p3.snf.ch/project-188795). My research interests include computer history, migration research and digital history. I am an advocate of open science, open access and open source.
